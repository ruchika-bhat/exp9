# AIM: STUDY OF NUMPY LIBRARY


# THEORY:
NumPy is mainly used for working with arrays and matrices. It helps in performing mathematical and statistical operations easily and efficiently.
NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful library used for numerical computations. 
It allows us to create arrays, check their dimensions, find their shape, and perform operations on them.
It is faster and more convenient than normal Python lists when working with large data.

# Declaration of NumPy Arrays:
In this experiment, NumPy is imported using import numpy as np. Two arrays are created: one one-dimensional array and one two-dimensional array. 
These arrays store numerical values and are printed to observe their structure.

# Dimension of an Array:
The ndim function is used to find the dimension of an array. A one-dimensional array has one axis, while a two-dimensional array has two axes (rows and columns). 
This helps us understand the structure of the data.

# Shape of an Array:
The shape function gives the number of rows and columns in an array. For a 1D array, it shows the number of elements.
For a 2D array, it shows rows and columns in the form (rows, columns).

# Data Type of an Array:
The dtype function is used to check the data type of the elements inside the array. If all elements are integers, the type will be integer.
If any value is decimal, NumPy automatically converts the type to float.

# Built-in Array Creation Functions:
NumPy provides built-in functions like zeros() to create a matrix of zeros, ones() to create a matrix of ones, and eye() to create an identity matrix.
These functions make matrix creation simple and quick.

# Range and Spacing Functions:
The arange() function generates numbers within a given range with a specific step value. The linspace() function generates equally spaced numbers between two values.
These functions are useful for creating sequences of numbers.

# Arithmetic Operations on Arrays:
NumPy allows direct mathematical operations on arrays. For example, adding a number to an array adds that number to every element.
Similarly, multiplying an array multiplies each element individually. This makes calculations easy and efficient.

# Statistical Functions:
NumPy provides statistical functions such as mean(), median(), max(), min(), sum(), and std(). These functions help in analyzing data quickly without writing complex code.


# CONCLUSION:
This experiment helped in understanding how to create and manipulate arrays using the NumPy library. It showed how to check dimensions, shapes, and data types, and how to perform mathematical and statistical operations.
Overall, NumPy makes numerical computations simple, fast, and efficient in Python programming.
